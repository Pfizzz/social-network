## Description
This app uses a NoSQL database built using MongoDB and that lays the foundation for a social networking platform. The app allows for users to add each other as friends and comment on each other's thoughts using Express js routing, a Node js runtime, and Mongoose to structure the schema for the User and Thought models.
